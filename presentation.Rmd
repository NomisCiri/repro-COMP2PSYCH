# Questions

* if you do not understand somethings:
  * it is **always** my fault
  * let me correct it by raising your hand
* if you want to dig deeper:
  * we have a tough schedule, but you will get an answer
  * raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/repro-COMP2PSYCH/issues/new)
* if I ask a yes-no-question:
  * white card up 🠖 yes
  * black card up🠖 no
  * no card up 🠖 don't care to answer

# R Markdown

* Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
* RMarkdown lets you combine:
  * code
  * the thoughts that let to it
  * its results

  in an multitude of output formats
* Reproducibility: text, code and results can't get out of sync

# Proof

I like coding, hence:

```{r}
toupper("code yeah!")
```

# Randome things 𝍩:

**Paths**

* relative paths 🠖 reproducible
* absolute paths 🠖 *never* reproducible
* `here::here()` is your friend

**Packages**

* to avoid errors, use plenty of packages
* *always* load packages at the top of a script
* be kind to your reproducers by using `pacman::p_load()`
  * loads many packages at once
  * installs them if needed

# Let's get to work

* duplo 🠖 probably longest chocolate in the world
* repro 🠖 probably shortest multilab study in the world

## Goal

* `~`16 labs in this room
* gather data and contribute them to a larger project

# Get your copy

  * open RStudio
  * File 🠖  New Project ... 🠖 Version Control 🠖 Git 🠖 paste link
* gather data
  * open `R/save.R`
  * admire the use of `pacman` & `here` 😁
  * change `"my_unique_name.csv"` to anything unique (A-z/0-9 only please)
  * Ctrl + A (mark everything)
  * Ctrl + Enter (run everything that is marked)

# See and contribute your results

* Open `markdown.Rmd` 🠖 Click Knit
